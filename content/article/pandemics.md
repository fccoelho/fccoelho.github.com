I have recently come across a publication I wrote quite a while ago. The magazine "Ciência Hoje" no longer exists but [the article](https://cienciahoje.periodicos.capes.gov.br/storage/acervo/ch/ch_224.pdf) can still be found online.

![Ciência Hoje Vol 38](/images/CH2006.png)

The article starts on page 26, and in it, Claudia and I discuss the history of pandemics and the role of active disease surveillance in combating them. We also Mention the SARS virus as a potential threat for future pandemic, together with Flu.

It is amazing to think that even knowing perfectly well the risks, No country put any decent plans in practice to mitigate the impact of an emerging pandemic of a highly transmissible virus. The SARS virus was contained and never became a pandemic, but the COVID-19 virus has become a pandemic and is still raging.
